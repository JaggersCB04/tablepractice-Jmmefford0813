<p>My favorite class is my 6th hour which is intro to art.Thats my faviorte because I love to draw and paint.I've been doing art for as long as i can remember.I also like my teacher for that class she's really cool and nice.Can't wait to go there tomorrow I hate its my 6th hour because I have to wait all day.</p>
