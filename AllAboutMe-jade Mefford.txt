<p>I have lived in arizona for 8 years and I love the summer.The summer is my faviorte because i go down to hawaii every summer and surf.I have one sibling and her name is alexis and she just turned 15 on wednesday.My mom and dad are divorced so we live in different apartments but hes only 10 minutes away.We are all ok with all of this though,were all a happy positive family.</p>
